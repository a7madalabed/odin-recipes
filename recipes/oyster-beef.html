    <h3>Best beef</h4>
    <p>Beef with oyster sauce is one of my favorite dishes for its simplicity. It’s got excellent flavor, beautiful texture, and is one of those dishes you can throw together any night. It impresses guests but is perfect for a dinner for two, too.</p>
    <p>Everyone always asks me how Chinese restaurants get beef to have such a tender texture. It’s a valid question since many times, the meat is of a tougher cut (such as flank or skirt steak). I’m going to show you exactly how to make beef with oyster sauce just like the restaurants do, and the simple ingredients that can help you achieve that sublime texture.</p>
    <h4>ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Marinated beef</li>
        <li>Chopped veggies (onion and asparagus)</li>
        <li>Aromatics (ginger and garlic)</li>
        <li>Mixed sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Sear the beef</li>
        <li>Cook the ginger, garlic and onion</li>
        <li>Stir fry with the asparagus</li>
    </ol>
